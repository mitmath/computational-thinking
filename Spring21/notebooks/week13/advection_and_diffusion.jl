So far we have been looking at dynamics in time, for example how does the temperature of the Earth change over time. But the Earth does not have a single, uniform temperature; rather, at a particular moment in time, different places on Earth are at different temperatures, and those different temperatures change over time due to several mechanisms. 

In this notebook we will look at two fundamental mechanisms: **advection** and **diffusion**. Let's think about the temperature in the ocean. Since the ocean is a fluid that is in motion, a warm "parcel" of water can flow (move) to a new location due to the physical motion of the water itself; this is **advection**.  And even if the water doesn't move, temperature or a higher concentration of some substance dissolved in the fluid can spread out due to molecular mechanisms; this is **diffusion**.

In this notebook we will restrict ourselves to one spatial dimension (1D).
So we will think about the temperature $T$, for example, being a function 

$$T(t, x)$$

of two independent variables:

- time, $t$
- space, $x$


We want to calculate a value of the temperature $T$ for each possible pair of values $(t, x)$, i.e. for all time ($>0$) and all positions.

The temperature at a given point will change due to different physical processes. We need to model this by writing down equations describing each physical process and how it affects the temperature. Since there are now *two* independent variables, $t$ and $x$, we can expect to end up with derivatives with respect to *both* of these variables, so that the rate of change of temperature in time at a given point depends also on gradients of the temperature in *space*. This will lead to a **partial differential equation** that relates *partial* derivatives of $T$.

In the context of climate modelling, we can think of $x$ as being the **latitude**, supposing that the temperature is the same at all points with the same latitude. In this way we could model the fact that the poles are cold and the equator is warm, and we could model how heat flows from hot to cold. 

However, we clearly cannot model actual ocean currents like this, which would require two, or even three, spatial dimensions.

An ordinary differential equation needs an initial value for each variable. Similarly, we will need an initial *function* $T_0(x)$ that gives us the temperature at each position $x$. Let's suppose that the position is restricted to the interval $[0, L_x]$.

As usual, to represent the continuous function $T_0(x)$ on a computer, we will need to **discretise** it in some way, i.e. *approximate* the continuous function by a *finite* set of numbers in the computer.

The simplest (but far from the only!) discretisation method is to **sample** the function at discrete **grid points** (or **nodes**) $x_i$, for $i = 1, \dots, N_x$. For simplicity we will take these equally spaced, with spacing $x_{i+1} - x_i =: \delta x := L_x / N_x$.

A useful way to think about $T^n_i$ is as some kind of (spatial) average of $T(t_n, x)$ over the interval of positions between neighbouring grid points, so $T_i$ is the average over the interval between $x_i - \frac{\delta x}{2}$ and $x_i + \frac{\delta x}{2}$.

Now let's think of this profile as representing the temperature in each small volume, or "parcel", of fluid. Let's suppose that the fluid is moving to the right with a constant, uniform speed $U$. (**Uniform** here means that the speed is the same in all parts of the fluid.) Then the temperature profile should also *move with the fluid*! We call a quantity, such as the temperature, that is carried along with the fluid a **tracer**.

If we fix our attention at a single, fixed point in space, say the grid point $x_i$, the temperature there will vary over time, due to the fact that the fluid is moving past it. How it varies in time depends on the values at neighbouring grid points, since they determine how much heat will be transported *into* and *out of* the current cell.

[The point of view where we fix our attention at one point in space is called **Eulerian**. The alternative is to follow a parcel of fluid as it moves along in space; this is called **Lagrangian**.]

Let's call $T^n_i$ the approximate (unknown) average value of $T$ in the cell at position $x_i$ and at the $n$th time step $t_n$, i.e. an approximation of $T(t_n, x_i)$, where $t_n = n \, \delta t$. 

Then $T^{n+1}_i \simeq T(t_n + \delta t, x_i)$ and $T^{n}_{i+1} \simeq T(t_n, x_i + \delta x)$.

[Note that the superscript $n$ in these algorithms does not mean a power; it's just a label for the time step. We could write $T_i^{(n)}$ instead, but that is annoying to both write and read, so we omit the parentheses.]

# ╔═╡ 44433a34-2782-11eb-0079-837c9306c5bd

Suppose the fluid is moving to the right with speed $U$. During a time step of duration $\delta t$, the temperature $T^n_i$ at cell $i$ changes for two reasons:

- some heat enters cell $i$
- some heat leaves cell $i$ 

Note that most of the fluid that starts within cell $i$ remains within that cell during the time step (if the time step is short enough), as we see from the visualisation above. 

To calculate how much heat enters and leaves, note that only heat in the region of fluid within a distance $U \, \delta t$ from the boundary of the cell will cross into that cell. So a *proportion* $(U \, \delta t) / \delta x$ of the amount in cell $i$ crosses the boundary.

[We will blur the distinction between "amount of heat" and temperature.]

Hence, roughly an amount $T^n_i (U \delta t) / \delta x$ will leave cell number $i$ and cross into cell $i+1$ (the cell to the right). Similarly, an amount $T^n_{i-1} (U \delta t) / \delta x$ will *enter* cell $i$ from the neighbouring cell $i-1$ on the left. 

Hence we arrive at the following:

$$T^{n+1}_i = T^{n}_i + (T^n_{i-1} - T^n_{i})\, U \, \delta t / \delta x.$$

Note that on the right-hand side we have quantities at the time step $n$, and on the left at time step $n+1$. So this tells us how to *update* our quantities from slice $n$ to slice $n+1$.

Taking the continuum limit when $\delta t \to 0$ and $\delta x \to 0$, we recognise the definition of **partial derivatives** with respect to time and space variables from multivariable calculus. (Note the different indices that change on the two sides of the equation.) 

Denoting these partial derivatives using $\partial$, we arrive at the **advection equation**:

$$\frac{\partial T(t, x)}{\partial t} = -U \frac{\partial T(t, x)}{\partial x},$$

or for short

$$\frac{\partial T}{\partial t} = -U \frac{\partial T}{\partial x}.$$


Since $T$ is a function of both $x$ and $t$, and this equation involves partial derivatives with respect to both of the independent variables, this is a **partial differential equation** (PDE). It describes how the function $T(t, x)$ changes continuously as a function both of time and space. 

Although there are some analytical methods to solve PDEs, often it's necessary to use numerical methods. Here we'll look at simple numerical methods to solve such equations.

$$T^{n+1}_i = T^{n}_i - \left( U \frac{\delta t}{\delta x} \right) (T^n_{i} - T^n_{i-1}).$$

In the last term on the right-hand side, we see that we require combinations of values of $T$ at the *same* time step from *different* places, with certain coefficients.

There are many approaches to implementing this numerically. The simplest is to directly transcribe the equation for the $i$th entry of the vector.

Calling `T` the current vector, i.e. $\mathbf{T}^n := (T^n_i)_{i=1, \ldots, N_x}$, and `T′` the new vector at the next time step, we have the following basic expression:

	T′[i] = T[i] + δt * U * (T[i-1] - T[i]) / δx

### Boundary conditions

This illustrates the necessity of choosing **boundary conditions** that specify what happens at the edge of the domain.

For simplicity we will choose to use **periodic boundary conditions**. This is a convenient mathematical fiction that allows us to treat all cells as being on the same footing, by wrapping the system around a torus, so that cells $i=1$ and $i=N_x$ are neighbours.

Another key physical process is **diffusion**. This models how temperature or mass spreads out from hot or high concentration regions towards regions where it is cold or where there is a low concentration.

## Physical mechanism: Random walks

The physical mechanism behind this is **random motion**: this is the continuous limit of equations describing the evolution of the probability distribution in space and time of a cloud of random walkers.

This is the same process that we studied in lecture 2.6.
Using our current notation, there we showed that the probability distribution of a cloud of random walkers satisfies the following time evolution:

$$p^{n+1}_i = \frac{1}{2}(p^n_{i-1} + p^n_{i+1})$$

If now we say that the walkers jump only with a certain probability, with a large probability to stay in the same place, and that these random walkers are the carriers of heat, then we get 

$$T^{n+1}_i = \kappa (T^n_{i-1} - 2 T^n_i + T^n_{i+1}).$$

$$\frac{\partial^2 T}{\partial x^2}(t_n, x_i) \simeq \frac{T^n_{i+1} - 2 T^n_i + T^n_{i-1}}{\delta x^2}.$$

Finally we can combine both mechanisms, to describe a tracer that is both being advected at a constant speed and diffusing. This basically utilises the composition of the advection and diffusion functions:
