In the previous lecture we started to look at Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs). These are equations relating a function to its derivatives, telling us how to move at each moment in time.

For example, exponential decay is modelled by

$$\dot{u} = -p \, u,$$

in other words

$$\dot{u}(t) = - p \, u(t)$$

for all real $t \ge 0$,

with initial condition 

$$u(0) = u_0$$

where $u(t)$ is the number of light bulbs still functioning at time $t$, the number of radioactive nuclei that have not yet decayed, or the number of people who are still infectious and have not yet recovered. The parameter $p$ is the decay rate.

We saw that **time stepping** methods provide a class of numerical methods for solving such initial-value problems, of which the Euler method is the simplest example.

Unfortunately the Euler method is *not* a good choice, since it is not accurate enough. In numerical analysis classes (like [18.330](https://github.com/mitmath/18330)) various better methods are derived.

Fortunately those methods are available in a Julia **library** or package, `DifferentialEquations.jl`.

[DifferentialEquations.jl](https://diffeq.sciml.ai/v2.0/) (often abbreviated as DiffEq) is a Julia library for solving many types of differential equations. It has become the best (most complete and fastest) general library for **solving** ordinary differential equations (and many other types) in any programming environment. It is also a very good example of the way that Julia libraries are often structured.

We will see some basic usage examples and how Julia **types** are used both to control the library and to store the input and output to the **solvers**.

Let's try to solve the above equation that we derived in the previous lecture, $\dot{u} = -p \, u$. (We are using $u$ as the name of the dependent variable for consistency with the `DifferentialEquations.jl` documentation and internal structure.)

We write a general ODE in 1 variable as 

$\dot{u} = f_p(t, u).$

The right-hand side of the ODE is given by a function $f$, which may depend on a **parameter** $p$, i.e. a constant which does not change for any given run of the ODE.
$f$ may also depend explicitly on time.

In our example we do indeed have a parameter $p$ that we want to change, but $f$ does not have an explicit time dependence, so we write

What happened here? A suitable solver (i.e. an algorithm to calculate the solution) was chosen *automatically*, and it chose certain moments in time at which to output information about the (approximate, but very accurate) solution. 

In this particular case it chose to output data at only eight points in time between $t=0$ and $t=10$.

Let's try to plot the `solution` object:

Two surprising things happen. Firstly, there is no reason to expect this to have worked: `solution` is some kind of Julia object, but somehow `Plots.jl` knows how to plot it. This is because `DifferentialEquations.jl` defines a **plot recipe**. This specifies a way to turn solution objects into plots! Any package can do this relatively easily.
"""

The second surprise is that the output looks like a smooth curve, rather than just 8 points. Let's see those points on top of the curve. We can extract the relevant data from the `solution` object:

We see that the package in fact gives not only the value at those points, but it is in fact also capable of calculating an (approximate) solution at *any* intermediate point, using **interpolation**. In fact, we can access this by treating `solution` as if it were a function:

Note that this makes objects (instances) of the type callable, rather than the type itself, which we can already call as a **constructor** to create objects of that type:
"""

However, it turns out that we then lose efficiency (speed). 

What we would need is two different types: one in which we specify the type of `times` as `Vector{Float64}`, and the other as `Vector{Vector{Float64}}`.

Julia provides a mechanism to define *both at once*: this is what parameterized types do!

# ╔═╡ 5d06734e-ffbd-421e-820e-609e373ccc7b

Let's define our own `MyODEProblem` type as a simple example. We specify type parameters for each variable:
"""

# ╔═╡ 62d55814-c863-4d4d-8582-908721d37326
struct MyODEProblem{T,U}
	t0::T
	tfinal::T
	
	u0::U
end

# ╔═╡ 470b7808-5ff6-4cda-82cc-2ac250d51909
md"""
Note that the starting and final times have been specified to require the *same* type `T`.
"""

# ╔═╡ d392de63-137e-43fb-86ca-4f344769bc71
md"""
Now if we create objects of this type, we see that Julia matches the types we pass in to the correct type parameters:
"""

# ╔═╡ e07830be-3aab-4410-a830-786a30eb162a
newprob = MyODEProblem(3, 4, 100.0)

# ╔═╡ 6d809ff0-20c5-4910-aca0-612496955812

newprob.u0

# ╔═╡ c29d4796-9e52-4234-8325-5bf31099c79d
md"""
If we change the types of the inputs, the type parameters change:
"""

# ╔═╡ 7e5b0073-1bc7-41c7-ae74-c9c1bdf6c6ea
MyODEProblem(3.0, 4.0, 100.0)

# ╔═╡ 67e36f7c-0cb9-4ead-82ad-4c47639802a8
md"""
If we mix types for the first two arguments then we get an error, since Julia can't match to a single type `T`:
"""

# ╔═╡ cdc25238-ed48-42e5-9db4-2367577b215d
