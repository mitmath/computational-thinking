# Images as examples of data  all around us
Welcome to the Computational Thinking using Julia for Real-World Problems, at MIT in Spring 2021!

The aim of this course is to bring together concepts from computer science and applied math with coding in the modern **Julia language**, and to see how to apply these techniques to study interesting applications (and of course to have fun).

We would be pleased if students who have been interested in computer science now become interested in computational science and those interested in scientific applications learn computer science they may not see elsewhere.
... and for all students, we wish to share the value of 
the Julia  language as the best of both worlds.

## Alan's Essay: Are all programming languages the same? 

>Superficially, many programming languages are very similar.  "Showoffs" will compare functional programming vs imperative programming.  Others will compare compiled languages vs dynamic languages.  I will avoid such fancy terms in this little essay, preferring to provide this course's pedagogical viewpoint.
>
>Generally speaking beginning programmers should learn to create "arrays" write "for loops", "conditionals", "comparisons", express mathematical formulas, etc. So why Julia at a time when Python seems to be the language of teaching, and Java and C++ so prominent in the corporate world?
>
>As you might imagine, we believe Julia is special.   Oh you will still have the nitty gritty of when to use a bracket and a comma.  You might have strong opinions as to whether arrays should begin with 0 or 1 (joke: some say it's time to compromise and use ½.)  Getting past these irrelevant issues,  you will begin to experience one by one what makes Julia so very special.  For starters, a language that runs fast is more fun.  We can have you try things that would just be so slow in other languages it would be boring.  We also think you will start to notice how natural Julia is, how it feels like the mathematics, and how flexible it can be.  
>
>Getting to see the true value of fancy terms like multiple dispatch, strong typing, generic programming, and composable software will take a little longer, but stick with us, and you too will see why Julia is so very special.

If we open an image on our computer or the web and zoom in enough, we will see that it consists of many tiny squares, or **pixels** ("picture elements"). Each pixel is a block of one single colour, and the pixels are arranged in a two-dimensional square grid. 

You probably already know that these pixels are stored in a computer numerically
perhaps in some form of RGB (red,green,blue) format.  This is the computer's represenation of the data.   

Note that an image is already an **approximation** of the real world -- it is a two-dimensional, discrete representation of a three-dimensional reality.

### Locations in an image: Indexing

Now suppose that we want to examine a piece of the image in more detail. We need some way of specifying which piece of the image we want. 

Thinking of the image as a grid of pixels, we need a way to tell the computer which pixel or group of pixels we want to refer to. 
Since the image is a two-dimensional grid, we can use two integers (whole numbers) to give the coordinates of a single pixel.  Specifying coordinates like this is called **indexing**: think of the index of a book, which tells you *on which page* an idea is discussed.

In Julia we use (square) brackets, `[` and `]` for indexing:

md"""
We see that Julia knows to draw our pixel object for us a block of the relevant color.

When we index into an image like this, the first number indicates the *row* in the image, starting from the top, and the second the *column*, starting from the left. In Julia, the first row and column are numbered starting from 1, not from 0 as in some other programming languages.

# Process: Modifying an image

Now that we have access to image data, we can start to **process** that data to extract information and/or modify it in some way.

We might want to detect what type of objects are in the image, say to detect whether a patient has a certain disease. To achieve a high-level goal like this, we will need to perform mid-level operations, such as detecting edges that separate different objects based on their color. And, in turn, to carry that out we will need to do low-level operations like comparing colors of neighboring pixels and somehow deciding if they are "different".

## Representing colors

We can  use indexing to *modify* a pixel's color. To do so, we need a way to specify a new color.

Color turns out to be a complicated concept, having to do with the interaction of the physical properties of light with the physiological mechanisms and mental processes by which we detect it!

We will ignore this complexity by using a standard method of representing colours in the computer as an **RGB triple**, i.e. a triple of three numbers $(r, g, b)$, giving the amount of red, of green and of blue in a colour, respectively. These are numbers between 0 (none) and 1 (full). The final colour that we perceive is the result of "adding" the corresponding amount of light of each colour; the details are fascinating, but beyond the scope of this course!

# Computer science: Arrays

An image is a concrete example of a fundamental concept in computer science, namely an **array**. 

Just as an image is a rectangular grid, where each grid cell contains a single color,
an array is a rectangular grid for storing data. Data is stored and retrieved using indexing, just as in the image examples: each cell in the grid can store a single "piece of data" of a given type.


## Dimension of an array

An array can be one-dimensional, like the strip of pixels above, two-dimensional, three-dimensional, and so on. The dimension tells us the number of indices that we need to specify a unique location in the grid.
The array object also needs to know the length of the data in each dimension.

## Names for different types of array

One-dimensional arrays are often called **vectors** (or, in some other languages, "lists") and two-dimensional arrays are **matrices**. Higher-dimensional arrays are  **tensors**.


## Arrays as data structures

An array is an example of a **data structure**, i.e. a way of arranging data such that we can access it. A key theme in computer science is that of designing different data structures that represent data in different ways.

Conceptually, we can think of an array as a block of data that has a position or location in space. This can be a useful way to arrange data if, for example, we want to represent the fact that values in nearby locations in array are somehow near to one another.

Images are a good example of this: neighbouring pixels often represent different pieces of the same object, for example the rug or floor, or Philip himself, in the photo. We thus expect neighbouring pixels to be of a similar color. On the other hand, if they are not, this is also useful information, since that may correspond to the edge of an object.

# Julia: constructing arrays

## Creating vectors and matrices
Julia has strong support for arrays of any dimension.

Vectors, or one-dimensional arrays, are written using square brackets and commas:
"""

# ╔═╡ f4b0aa23-2d76-4d88-b2a4-3807e88d27ce
[1, 20, "hello"]

# ╔═╡ 1b2b2b18-64d4-11eb-2d43-e31cb8bc25d1

# ╔═╡ 2b0e6450-64d4-11eb-182b-ff1bd515b56f
md"""
Matrices, or two-dimensional arrays, also use square brackets, but with spaces and new lines instead of commas:
"""

# ╔═╡ 3b2b041a-64d4-11eb-31dd-47d7321ee909

# ╔═╡ 0f35603a-64d4-11eb-3baf-4fef06d82daa
md"""

## Array comprehensions

It's clear that if we want to create an array with more than a few elements, it will be *very* tedious to do so by hand like this.
Rather, we want to *automate* the process of creating an array by following some pattern, for example to create a whole palette of colors!

Let's start with all the possible colors interpolating between black, `RGB(0, 0, 0)`, and red, `RGB(1, 0, 0)`.  Since only one of the values is changing, we can represent this as a vector, i.e. a one-dimensional array.

A neat method to do this is an **array comprehension**. Again we use square brackets  to create an array, but now we use a **variable** that varies over a given **range** values:
"""

# ╔═╡ e69b02c6-64d6-11eb-02f1-21c4fb5d1043
[RGB(x, 0, 0) for x in 0:0.1:1]

# ╔═╡ fce76132-64d6-11eb-259d-b130038bbae6
md"""
Here, `0:0.1:1` is a **range**; the first and last numbers are the start and end values, and the middle number is the size of the step.
"""

# ╔═╡ 17a69736-64d7-11eb-2c6c-eb5ebf51b285
md"""
In a similar way we can create two-dimensional matrices, by separating the two variables for each dimension with a comma (`,`):
"""

# ╔═╡ 291b04de-64d7-11eb-1ee0-d998dccb998c
[RGB(i, j, 0) for i in 0:0.1:1, j in 0:0.1:1]
