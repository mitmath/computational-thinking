\blurb{This is an introductory course on Computational Thinking. We use the [Julia programming language](http://www.julialang.org) to approach real-world problems in varied areas applying data analysis and computational and mathematical modeling.  In this class you will learn computer science, software, algorithms, applications, and mathematics as an integrated whole.}

Topics include:

- Image analysis
- Particle dynamics and ray tracing
- Epidemic propagation
- Climate modeling

### Discussion forum and homework submission
- [Discord](https://discord.gg/Z5qnVf8): discussion (we encourage you to hang out here during class!)

- [Piazza](https://piazza.com/class/kd33x1xnfyq3b1): (MIT only) allows for anonymity to other students, discussion

- [Canvas](https://canvas.mit.edu/courses/5637): (MIT only) homework submission. If you're a non-MIT student, please find a partner to cross-grade homeworks via Discord.


### Evaluation

*   12 weekly problem sets with equal weight; your lowest score will be dropped. 

*   Released on Thursdays and due before the following Thursday's class. (No problem set during Thanskgiving week.)

*   No exams

Problem sets consist of code. MIT students enrolled in the course must submit homeworks via Canvas. If you are not a student then we encourage you to join the Discord and find a cross-grading partner.
