# Homework 0: Getting set up

Homeworks are in the form of Pluto notebooks. Your must complete them and submit them on Canvas (if you are an MIT student.). If you are not an MIT student, we encourage you to join discord and find someone to cross-grade.

HW0 due date: Thursday, 10th Sep 2020

Homeworks will be released on Thursdays and due on Thursdays 11:59pm Eastern time.

HW0 is for you to get your system set up correctly and to test our grading software. You must submit it but it will not count towards your grade.
