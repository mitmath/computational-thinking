# 18.S191: Introduction to computational thinking for real-world problems

## Fall 2020

Welcome to the new MIT course 18.S191!

This is an introductory course on Computational Thinking, using the modern [Julia programming language](http://www.julialang.org), to approach real-world problems in the following areas via data analysis and computational and mathematical modeling:

- Image analysis
- Particle dynamics and ray tracing
- Epidemic propagation
- Climate modeling


### Course Materials
Course materials will be posted [here](syllabus.md).

Julia learning materials may be found [here](http://www.julialang.org/learning)
