# **Homework 9**: _Epidemic modeling III_
`18.S191`, Spring 2021

This notebook contains _built-in, live answer checks_! In some exercises you will see a coloured box, which runs a test case on your code, and provides feedback based on the result. Simply edit the code, run it, and the check runs again.

_For MIT students:_ there will also be some additional (secret) test cases that will be run as part of the grading process, and we will look at your notebook and write comments.

Feel free to ask questions!

In this problem set, we will look at a simple **spatial** agent-based epidemic model: agents can interact only with other agents that are *nearby*.  (In Homework 7, any agent could interact with any other, which is not realistic.)

A simple approach is to use **discrete space**: each agent lives
in one cell of a square grid. For simplicity we will allow no more than
one agent in each cell, but this requires some care to
design the rules of the model to respect this.

We will adapt some functionality from Homework 7. You should copy and paste your code from that homework into this notebook.

#### Exercise 1.2
In Julia, operations like `+` and `*` are just functions, and they are treated like any other function in the language. The only special property you can use the _infix notation_: you can write
```julia
1 + 2
```
instead of 
```julia
+(1, 2)
```
_(There are [lots of special 'infixable' function names](https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/blob/master/src/julia-parser.scm#L23-L24) that you can use for your own functions!)_

When you call it with the prefix notation, it becomes clear that it really is 'just another function', with lots of predefined methods.

#### Exercise 1.5
Agents live in a box of side length $2L$, centered at the origin. We need to decide (i.e. model) what happens when they reach the walls of the box (boundaries), in other words what kind of **boundary conditions** to use.

One relatively simple boundary condition is a **collision boundary**:

> Each wall of the box is a wall, modelled using "collision": if the walker tries to jump beyond the wall, it ends up at the position inside the box that is closest to the goal.

👉 Write a function `collide_boundary` which takes a `Coordinate` `c` and a size $L$, and returns a new coordinate that lies inside the box (i.e. ``[-L,L]\times [-L,L]``), but is closest to `c`. This is similar to `extend_mat` from Homework 1.

#### Exercise 4.2
Not all two agents who end up in the same grid point may actually interact in an infectious way -- they may just be passing by and do not create enough exposure for communicating the disease.

👉 Write a new `interact!` method on `SocialAgent` which adds together the social_scores for two agents and uses that as the probability that they interact in a risky way. Only if they interact in a risky way, the infection is transmitted with the usual probability.

## **Exercise 5:** (Optional) _Effect of distancing_

We can use a variant of the above model to investigate the effect of the
mis-named "social distancing"  
(we want people to be *socially* close, but *physically* distant).

In this variant, we separate out the two effects "infection" and
"movement": an infected agent chooses a
neighbouring site, and if it finds a susceptible there then it infects it
with probability $p_I$. For simplicity we can ignore recovery.

Separately, an agent chooses a neighbouring site to move to,
and moves there with probability $p_M$ if the site is vacant. (Otherwise it
stays where it is.)

When $p_M = 0$, the agents cannot move, and hence are
completely quarantined in their original locations.

👉 How does the disease spread in this case?
