# Introduction
Welcome to the Computational Thinking using Julia for Real-World Problems, at MIT in Spring 2021!

The aim of this course is to bring together concepts from computer science and applied math with coding in the modern **Julia language**, and to see how to apply these techniques to study interesting applications.

## Data are all around us
Applications of computer science in the real world use **data**, i.e. information that we can **measure** in some way. Data take many different forms, for example:

- Numbers that change over time (**time series**): 
  - Stock price each second / minute / day
  - Weekly number of infections

- Video:
  - The view from a window of a self-driving car
  - A hurricane monitoring station

- Images:
  - Diseased versus healthy tissue in a medical scan
  - Your social media account labelling your friends in your photos

#### Exercise: 
> Think of another two examples in each category. Can you think of other categories of data?


To use any data source, we need to **input** the data of interest, for example by downloading it, reading in the resulting file, and converting it into a form that we can use in the computer. Then we need to **process** it in some way to extract information of interest. We usually want to **visualize** the results, and we may want to **output** them, for example by saving to disc or putting them on a website.

We also may want to make a mathematical or computational **model** that can help us to understand and predict the behavior of the system of interest.

In this course we aim to show how programming, computer science and applied math combine to help us with these goals.

# Images 

Let's start off by looking at **images** and how we can process them. 
Our goal is to process the data contained in an image in some way, which we will do by developing and coding certain **algorithms**.

To begin, though, let's take advantage of the fact that Julia already has various tools that have been written for more mundane tasks, such as converting an image input file from its particular format into numerical data that we can use.

## What is an image? 

If we open an image on our computer or the web and zoom in enough, we will see that it consists of many tiny squares, or **pixels** ("picture elements"). Each pixel is a block of one single colour, and the pixels are arranged in a two-dimensional square grid. 

Note that an image is already an **approximation** of the real world -- it is a two-dimensional, discrete representation of a three-dimensional reality.

## Julia: Reading in an image file
"""

md"""
To make things more concrete, let's use Julia to load in an actual image and play around with it.

One nice option is to use your computer's webcam to take a photo of yourself; another is to download one from the web.

We can use the `Images.jl` package to load an image file.
"""

# ╔═╡ 62fa19da-64c6-11eb-0038-5d40a6890cf5
md"""
First we specify the URL to download from:
"""

# ╔═╡ 34ee0954-601e-11eb-1912-97dc2937fd52
url = "https://i.imgur.com/VGPeJ6s.jpg" 

# ╔═╡ 9180fbcc-601e-11eb-0c22-c920dc7ee9a9
md"""
Now we use the aptly-named `download` function to download the image file to our own computer:
"""

# ╔═╡ 34ffc3d8-601e-11eb-161c-6f9a07c5fd78
download(url, "philip.jpg")  # download to a local file

# ╔═╡ abaaa980-601e-11eb-0f71-8ff02269b775
md"""
Using the `Images.jl` package we can **load** the file, which automatically converts it into usable data. We'll store the result in a variable:
"""

# ╔═╡ aafe76a6-601e-11eb-1ff5-01885c5238da
my_image = load("philip.jpg")

# ╔═╡ c99d2aa8-601e-11eb-3469-497a246db17c
md"""
We see that the Pluto notebook has recognised that we created an object representing an image, and automatically displayed the resulting image of Philip, the cute Welsh Pembroke corgi and co-professor of this course.
Poor Philip will undergo quite a few transformations as we go along!

### Image size
"""

# ╔═╡ 6f928b30-602c-11eb-1033-71d442feff93
md"""
The first thing we might want to know is the size of the image:
"""

# ╔═╡ 75c5c85a-602c-11eb-2fb1-f7e7f2c5d04b
size(my_image)

# ╔═╡ 77f93eb8-602c-11eb-1f38-efa56cc93ca5
md"""
Julia returns a pair of two numbers. Comparing these with the picture of the image, we see that the first number is the height, i.e. the vertical number of pixels, and the second is the width.
"""

# ╔═╡ f9244264-64c6-11eb-23a6-cfa76f8aff6d
md"""
### Locations in an image: Indexing

Now suppose that we want to examine a piece of the image in more detail. We need some way of specifying which piece of the image we want. 

Thinking of the image as a grid of pixels, we need a way to tell the computer which pixel or group of pixels we want to refer to. 
Since the image is a two-dimensional grid, we can use two integers (whole numbers) to give the coordinates of a single pixel.  Specifying coordinates like this is called **indexing**: think of the index of a book, which tells you *on which page* an idea is discussed.

In Julia we use (square) brackets, `[` and `]` for indexing: 
"""

# ╔═╡ bd22d09a-64c7-11eb-146f-67733b8be241
a_pixel = my_image[1000, 1500]

# ╔═╡ 28860d48-64c8-11eb-240f-e1232b3638df
md"""
We see that Julia knows to draw our pixel object for us a block of the relevant color.
"""

# ╔═╡ 622f514e-64c8-11eb-0c67-c7940e894973
md"""
When we index into an image like this, the first number indicates the *row* in the image, starting from the top, and the second the *column*, starting from the left. In Julia, the first row and column are numbered starting from 1, not from 0 as in some other programming languages.
"""

# ╔═╡ 4504577c-64c8-11eb-343b-3369b6d10d8b
md"""
### Representing colors

We can also use indexing to *modify* a pixel's color. To do so we need a way to specify a new color.

Color turns out to be a complicated concept, having to do with the interaction of the physical properties of light with the physiological mechanisms and mental processes by which we detect it!

We will ignore this complexity by using a standard method of representing colours in the computer as an **RGB triple**, i.e. a triple of three numbers $(r, g, b)$, giving the amount of red, of green and of blue in a colour, respectively. These are numbers between 0 (none) and 1 (full). The final colour that we perceive is the result of "adding" the corresponding amount of light of each colour; the details are fascinating, but beyond the scope of this course!
"""

# ╔═╡ 40886d36-64c9-11eb-3c69-4b68673a6dde
md"""
We can create a new color in Julia as follows:
"""

# ╔═╡ 552235ec-64c9-11eb-1f7f-f76da2818cb3
RGB(1.0, 0.0, 0.0)

# ╔═╡ 5a0cc342-64c9-11eb-1211-f1b06d652497
md"""
# Image processing

Now that we have access to image data, we can start to **process** that data to extract information and/or modify it in some way.

We might want to detect what type of objects are in the image, say to detect whether a patient has a certain disease. To achieve a high-level goal like this, we will need to perform mid-level operations, such as detecting edges that separate different objects based on their color. And, in turn, to carry that out we will need to do low-level operations like comparing colors of neighboring pixels and somehow deciding if they are "different".

"""

# ╔═╡ 2ee543b2-64d6-11eb-3c39-c5660141787e
md"""

## Modifying a pixel

Let's start by seeing how to modify an image, e.g. in order to hide sensitive information.

We do this by assigning a new value to the color of a pixel:
"""

# ╔═╡ 62da7c94-64c9-11eb-10dd-a374ce105d81
my_image[1000, 1500] = RGB(1.0, 0.0, 0.0)

# ╔═╡ 81b88cbe-64c9-11eb-3b26-39011efb2089
md"""
Be careful: We are actually *modifying* the original image here, even though if we look at the image it is hard to spot, since a single pixel is so small:
"""

# ╔═╡ 73511646-64c9-11eb-24a2-05a55c9c7500
my_image

# ╔═╡ ab9af0f6-64c9-11eb-13d3-5dbdb75a69a7
md"""
## Groups of pixels

We probably want to examine and modify several pixels at once.
For example, we can extract a horizontal strip 1 pixel tall:
"""

# ╔═╡ e29b7954-64cb-11eb-2768-47de07766055
my_image[1000, 1500:1700]

# ╔═╡ 8e7c4866-64cc-11eb-0457-85be566a8966
md"""
Here, Julia is showing the strip as a collection of rectangles in a row.
"""

# ╔═╡ f2ad501a-64cb-11eb-1707-3365d05b300a
md"""
And then modify it:
"""

# ╔═╡ b21eb2f2-64c9-11eb-2cec-d9e61c41cfe2
my_image[1000, 1500:1700] .= RGB(1.0, 0.0, 0.0)

# ╔═╡ 2808339c-64cc-11eb-21d1-c76a9854aa5b
md"""
Similarly we can modify a whole rectangular block of pixels:
"""

# ╔═╡ 33ec0666-64cc-11eb-009f-7502ac8be05f
my_image[1000:1100, 1500:1700] .= RGB(1.0, 0.0, 0.0)

# ╔═╡ 841af282-64cc-11eb-2f98-cb9d43b55ff7
md"""
and look at the result:
"""

# ╔═╡ 3679a622-64cc-11eb-007f-5bb908aec7c3
my_image

# ╔═╡ 693af19c-64cc-11eb-31f3-57ab2fbae597
md"""
## Reducing the size of an image
"""

# ╔═╡ 6361d102-64cc-11eb-31b7-fb631b632040
md"""
Maybe we would also like to reduce the size of this image, since it's rather large. For example, we could take every 10th row and every 10th column and make a new image from the result:
"""

# ╔═╡ ae542fe4-64cc-11eb-29fc-73b7a66314a9
reduced_image = my_image[1:10:end, 1:10:end]

# ╔═╡ c29292b8-64cc-11eb-28db-b52c46e865e6
md"""
Note that the resulting image doesn't look very good, since we seem to have lost too much detail. 

#### Exercise

> Think about what we might do to reduce the size of an image without losing so much detail.
"""

# ╔═╡ 5319c03c-64cc-11eb-0743-a1612476e2d3
md"""
## Saving an image

Finally, we want to be able to save our new creation to a file: 
"""

# ╔═╡ 3db09d92-64cc-11eb-0333-45193c0fd1fe
save("reduced_phil.jpg", reduced_image)

# ╔═╡ dd183eca-6018-11eb-2a83-2fcaeea62942
md"""
# Computer science: Arrays

An image is a concrete example of a fundamental concept in computer science, namely an **array**. 

Just as an image is a rectangular grid, where each grid cell contains a single color,
an array is a rectangular grid for storing data. Data is stored and retrieved using indexing, just as in the image examples: each cell in the grid can store a single "piece of data" of a given type.


## Dimension of an array

An array can be one-dimensional, like the strip of pixels above, two-dimensional, three-dimensional, and so on. The dimension tells us the number of indices that we need to specify a unique location in the grid.
The array object also needs to know the length of the data in each dimension.

## Names for different types of array

One-dimensional arrays are often called **vectors** (or, in some other languages, "lists") and two-dimensional arrays are **matrices**. Higher-dimensional arrays are  **tensors**.


## Arrays as data structures

An array is an example of a **data structure**, i.e. a way of arranging data such that we can access it. A key theme in computer science is that of designing different data structures that represent data in different ways.

Conceptually, we can think of an array as a block of data that has a position or location in space. This can be a useful way to arrange data if, for example, we want to represent the fact that values in nearby locations in array are somehow near to one another.

Images are a good example of this: neighbouring pixels often represent different pieces of the same object, for example the rug or floor, or Philip himself, in the photo. We thus expect neighbouring pixels to be of a similar color. On the other hand, if they are not, this is also useful information, since that may correspond to the edge of an object.

# Julia: Syntax for creating arrays

## Creating vectors and matrices
Julia has strong support for arrays of any dimension.

Vectors, or one-dimensional arrays, are written using square brackets and commas:
"""

# ╔═╡ 1b2b2b18-64d4-11eb-2d43-e31cb8bc25d1
[RGB(1, 0, 0), RGB(0, 1, 0), RGB(0, 0, 1)]

# ╔═╡ 2b0e6450-64d4-11eb-182b-ff1bd515b56f
md"""
Matrices, or two-dimensional arrays, also use square brackets, but with spaces and new lines instead of commas:
"""

# ╔═╡ 3b2b041a-64d4-11eb-31dd-47d7321ee909
[RGB(1, 0, 0)  RGB(0, 1, 0)
 RGB(0, 0, 1)  RGB(0.5, 0.5, 0.5)]

# ╔═╡ 0f35603a-64d4-11eb-3baf-4fef06d82daa
md"""

## Array comprehensions

It's clear that if we want to create an array with more than a few elements, it will be *very* tedious to do so by hand like this.
Rather, we want to *automate* the process of creating an array by following some pattern, for example to create a whole palette of colors!

Let's start with all the possible colors interpolating between black, `RGB(0, 0, 0)`, and red, `RGB(1, 0, 0)`.  Since only one of the values is changing, we can represent this as a vector, i.e. a one-dimensional array.

A neat method to do this is an **array comprehension**. Again we use square brackets  to create an array, but now we use a **variable** that varies over a given **range** values:
"""

# ╔═╡ e69b02c6-64d6-11eb-02f1-21c4fb5d1043
[RGB(i, 0, 0) for i in 0:0.1:1]

# ╔═╡ fce76132-64d6-11eb-259d-b130038bbae6
md"""
Here, `0:0.1:1` is a **range**; the first and last numbers are the start and end values, and the middle number is the size of the step.
"""

# ╔═╡ 17a69736-64d7-11eb-2c6c-eb5ebf51b285
md"""
In a similar way we can create two-dimensional matrices, by separating the two variables for each dimension with a comma (`,`):
"""

# ╔═╡ 291b04de-64d7-11eb-1ee0-d998dccb998c
[RGB(i, j, 0) for i in 0:0.1:1, j in 0:0.1:1]

Suppose we want to see the effect of changing the number of colors in our vector or matrix. We could, of course, do so by manually fiddling with the range.

It would be nice if we could do so using a **user interface**, for example with a **slider**. Fortunately, the Pluto notebook allows us to do so!
