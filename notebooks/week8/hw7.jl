## **Exercise 1:** _Agent-based model for an epidemic outbreak -- types_

In this and the following exercises we will develop a simple stochastic model for combined infection and recovery in a population, which may exhibit an **epidemic outbreak** (i.e. a large spike in the number of infectious people).
The population is **well mixed**, i.e. everyone is in contact with everyone else.
[An example of this would be a small school or university in which people are
constantly moving around and interacting with each other.]

The model is an **individual-based** or **agent-based** model: 
we explicitly keep track of each individual, or **agent**, in the population and their
infection status. For the moment we will not keep track of their position in space;
we will just assume that there is some mechanism, not included in the model, by which they interact with other individuals.

#### Exercise 1.1

Each agent will have its own **internal state**, modelling its infection status, namely "susceptible", "infectious" or "recovered". We would like to code these as values `S`, `I` and `R`, respectively. One way to do this is using an [**enumerated type**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enumerated_type) or **enum**. Variables of this type can take only a pre-defined set of values; the Julia syntax is as follows:
"""

# ╔═╡ 26f84600-041d-11eb-1856-b12a3e5c1dc7
@enum InfectionStatus S I R

# ╔═╡ 271ec5f0-041d-11eb-041b-db46ec1465e0
md"""
We have just defined a new type `InfectionStatus`, as well as names `S`, `I` and `R` that are the (only) possible values that a variable of this type can take.

👉 Define a variable `test_status` whose value is `S`.

md"""
#### Exercise 1.2

For each agent we want to keep track of its infection status and the number of *other* agents that it infects during the simulation. A good solution for this is to define a *new type* `Agent` to hold all of the information for one agent, as follows:
"""

# ╔═╡ ae4ac4b4-041f-11eb-14f5-1bcde35d18f2
mutable struct Agent
	status::InfectionStatus
	num_infected::Int64
end

# ╔═╡ ae70625a-041f-11eb-3082-0753419d6d57
md"""
When you define a new type like this, Julia automatically defines one or more **constructors**, which are methods of a generic function with the *same name* as the type. These are used to create objects of that type. 

👉 Use the `methods` function to check how many constructors are pre-defined for the `Agent` type.

👉 For convenience, define a new constructor (i.e. a new method for the function) that takes no arguments and creates an `Agent` with status `S` and number infected 0, by calling one of the default constructors that Julia creates. This new method lives *outside* (not inside) the definition of the `struct`. (It is called an **outer constructor**.)

(In Pluto, a struct definition and an outer constructor need to be combined in a single cell using a `begin end` block.)

Let's check that the new method works correctly. How many methods does the constructor have now?

## **Exercise 2:** _Agent-based model for an epidemic outbreak --  Monte Carlo simulation_

In this exercise we will build on Exercise 2 to write a Monte Carlo simulation of how an infection propagates in a population.

Make sure to re-use the functions that we have already written, and introduce new ones if they are helpful! Short functions make it easier to understand what the function does and build up new functionality piece by piece.

You should not use any global variables inside the functions: Each function must accept as arguments all the information it requires to carry out its task. You need to think carefully about what the information each function requires.

#### Exercise 2.1

👉 Write a function `step!` that takes a vector of `Agent`s and an `infection` of type `InfectionRecovery`. It implements a single step of the infection dynamics as follows: 

- Choose two random agents: an `agent` and a `source`.
- Apply `interact!(agent, source, infection)`.
- Return `agents`.

#### Exercise 2.2
Alright! Every time that we run the simulation, we get slightly different results, because it is based on randomness. By running the simulation a number of times, you start to get an idea of the _mean behaviour_ of our model. This is the essence of a Monte Carlo method! You use computer-generated randomness to generate samples.

Instead of pressing the button many times, let's have the computer repeat the simulation. In the next cells, we run your simulation `num_simulations=20` times with $N=100$, $p_\text{infection} = 0.02$, $p_\text{infection} = 0.002$ and $T = 1000$. 

Every single simulation returns a named tuple with the status counts, so the result of multiple simulations will be an array of those. Have a look inside the result, `simulations`, and make sure that its structure is clear.
