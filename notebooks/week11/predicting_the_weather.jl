Will it rain tomorrow? We should be able to predict that using observations about the current state of the atmosphere and mathematical models in the form of partial differential equations that predict how the wind will move the air around, what the temperature will be, and how much water can precipitate out.

What about predicting rain next week? Next year?

We know from experience that we can only predict the weather in the short term, up to a week or so (and still only with a certain probability). Predicting even one month out doesn't seem possible.

On the other hand, we can talk about the *climate* and how it behaves on much longer time scales, e.g. "the average temperature in in Boston in April is 55°F". The short-term weather has a significant random (or apparently random) component, but becomes much more predictable when we look at statistical properties like averages and standard deviations; this is then called **climate**.

Recall that we are looking at **differential equations**, with the goal of modelling the evolution in time of the climate.

The simplest such models are **ordinary differential equations** (ODEs), where one or a few continuous variables evolve continuously in time, with a model that specifies their instantaneous rate of change as a function of their current values.

The general form of an ODE (that does not depend explicitly on time, i.e. that is **autonomous**), is

$$\frac{dx(t)}{dt} = f(x(t)),$$

or

$$\dot{x}(t) = f(x(t)),$$

with an initial condition $x(t=0) = x_0$.

Here $\dot{x}(t)$ denotes the derivative of the function $t \mapsto x(t)$ at time $t$.
"""

# ╔═╡ d21f6358-220c-11eb-00b8-03fe0746fdc9

We have seen that the simplest numerical method to solve such an equation is the **(forward) Euler method**, in which we convert this equation into an explicit time-stepping routine: we take a small time step of length $h$ and approximate the derivative as

$$\frac{dx(t)}{dt} \simeq \frac{x(t + h) - x(t)}{h},$$

giving the numerical method

$$x_{n+1} = x_{n} + h f(x_n),$$

where $x_n$ is the approximation of the true solution $x(t_n)$ at the $n$th time step $t_n$.

Let's use this to simulate a simple nonlinear ODE describing the dynamics of a population of bacteria. The bacteria reproduce at a rate $\lambda$ *provided* that there is sufficient food, in which case we would have $\dot{x} = \lambda x$. But the need for enough food will put a *limit* on the sustainable population to a value $K$, sometimes called the **carrying capacity**. 

The simplest model for the combined effect of growth and saturation is as follows:

$$\dot{x} = \lambda \, x \, (K - x).$$

When $x$ is close to $0$, the growth rate is $\lambda$, but that rate decreases as $x$ increases.

(This is sometimes called the [**logistic**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_function#Logistic_differential_equation) differential equation, although that name does not seem particularly helpful.)

Our goal is to use computational thinking, but we will actually not be interested so much in the exact dynamics in time, but rather in the **qualitative** features of the behaviour of the system. For example, at long times (formally $t \to \infty$) does the population get arbitrarily large? Or does it, for example, oscillate around a particular value? Or does it converge to a particular size? This forms the subject of **nonlinear dynamics** or **dynamical systems** theory.

Let's simulate the system using the Euler method to try to guess the answer to this question. Note that there are many much more sophisticated methods for solving ODEs collected in the DifferentialEquations.jl package. We should never use the Euler method in practice, but should use a tried and tested library instead, and algorithms that provide much better accuracy in the solutions, if we are interested in faithful numerical results.

It's useful to rescale the variables to the simplest form:

$$\dot{x} = x \, (1 - x).$$

[We can do so by defining new adimensional space and time variables $x'$ and $t'$ as follows: $x = K \, x'$, giving $K \dot{x'} = \lambda K \, x' (K - K x')$, and then $t' = \lambda K \, t$, giving $dx' / dt' = x' (1 - x')$.]

"""

# ╔═╡ 446c564e-220f-11eb-191a-6b419e790f3f
md"""
We see that all the curves starting near to $x_0=1.0$ seem to converge to 1 at long times. If the system starts *exactly* at 0 then it stays there forever. However, if it starts close to 0, on either side, then it moves *away* from 0 (on that same side of 0) -- starting from a negative value $x$ becomes ever more negative. (Even though negative populations have no meaning in the original interpretation as the dynamics of a population, we can still ask study the dynamics of the equation with negative initial conditions, since it may model other systems too.)

The special values $x^*_1=1$ and $x^*_2=0$ are called **stationary points** or **fixed points** of the differential equation. If we start at $x^*_i$, then the derivative there is $f'(x^*_i) = 0$, and hence we cannot move away from $x^*_i$! The fixed points can be found as zeros or **roots** of the function $f$, i.e. values $x^*$ such that $f(x^*) = 0$.
"""

# ╔═╡ 38894c32-2210-11eb-26ff-d9796edd7871
md"""
We see, though, that the two types of fixed points are **qualitatively different**: trajectories that start close to $x^*_1 = 1$ move *towards* $x^*_1$, whereas trajectories that start close to $x^*_2 = 0$ move *away* from it. We say that $x^*_1$ is a **stable fixed point** and $x^*_2$ is an **unstable fixed point**.

In general it is not possible to find analytical formulas for the position and stability of fixed points; instead, we can use numerical **root-finding algorithms**, for example the Newton method. There are various Julia packages with implementations of these algorithms; we will use `Roots.jl`, which works well for scalar-valued functions.

md"""
If we want to find the whole trajectory for a given initial condition then we need to solve the equations, either numerically or analytically.

However, we may want less information about the system, for example the **long-time** or **asymptotic** dynamics. It turns out that we can obtain some information about that *without* explicitly solving the ODE! This is the **qualitative approach** to studying nonlinear systems.

Instead of drawing trajectories $x(t)$ as a function of time $t$, as we did above, let's use a different graphical representation, where we draw **state space** or **phase space**: This is the set ("space") of all possible values of the dependent variables ("states"). For the above ODE there is only a single dependent variable, $x$, so the state space is the real line, $\mathbb{R}$.

At each possible value of $x$, the ODE gives us information about the rate of change of $x(t)$ at that point. Let's draw an **arrow** at that point, pointing in the direction that a particle placed at that point would move: to the right if $\dot{x} > 0$ and to the left if $\dot{x} < 0$.

This vector field indeed gives us a *qualitative* picture of the dynamics. It does not tell us how fast the dynamics will occur in each region, but it indicates what the *tendency* is. We have coded the fixed points according to their stability; this may be calculated using the derivative evaluated at the fixed point, $f'(x^*)$, since this derivative controls the behaviour of nearby initial conditions $x^* + \delta x$.
The unstable fixed point is shown as a green square, and the stable fixed point as a grey circle; we will use this convention throughout the notebook.

Suppose we now think about slowly varying the parameter $\mu$. If we change the parameter $\mu$ by a little, the system is no longer at a fixed point, since the position of the fixed point moves when $\mu$ changes. However, the system will then **relax**: it will follow the dynamics at the new value of $\mu$, and will rapidly converge to the new fixed point nearby for that new value of $\mu$.

For example, starting at $\mu=-2$, the system will stay on the lower black (stable) **branch** until $\mu=0.4$ or so. At that point, two fixed points collide and annihilate each other! After that there is no longer a fixed point nearby. However, there is another fixed point much further up that will now attract all trajectories, so the system rapidly transitions to that fixed point.

Now suppose we decrease the parameter again. The system will now track the *upper* branch until $\mu=-0.4$ or so, when again it will jump back down.

For each parameter value $\mu$ in the interval $[-0.4, 0.4]$ there is **bistability**, i.e. **coexistence** of *two* fixed points with the same value of $\mu$ (together with a third, unstable fixed point that is not observable).

The fact that the system tracks different stable branches depending on where we started, i.e. on the history of the dynamics, is known as **hysteresis**.

What are we actually doing when we let the parameter $\mu$ vary? Effectively we now have a system of *two* coupled ODEs, for example

$$\dot{x} = \mu + x - x^3;$$
$$\dot{\mu} = \epsilon,$$

where $\mu$ varies at a slow speed $\epsilon$. On a time scale much shorter than $1 / \epsilon$, the dynamics of $x$ "does not know" that $\mu$ is changing, so it will converge to a fixed point $x^*(\mu)$ for the current value of $\mu$. [An associated term is **adiabatic approximation**.] However, in fact $\mu$ does gradually change, so the value of $x$ will effectively "slide along" the curve $x(t) \simeq x^*(\mu(t))$, tracking the curve of fixed points as $\mu$ changes.

Once $\mu$ reaches a critical value $\mu_c$, however, there is no longer a nearby fixed point to move to, and the vector field will move the system to rapidly transition to the far away alternative fixed point.

If we now reverse the dynamics of $\mu$, we slide back along the upper branch.

Deterministic chaos occurs when nearby initial conditions separate exponentially fast in state space. This has been given the name **butterly effect**: the perturbation to the atmosphere's state caused by a butterfly flapping its wings could end up being magnified to modify the direction in which a tornado moves. 

We can see this in a simple way by perturbing the initial condition slightly and calculating the distance between the two systems as a function of $t$:
